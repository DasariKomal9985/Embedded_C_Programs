⚡ Interrupt Method Vs Polling Method:

🔁 Polling Method:


Polling is like constantly checking if something has happened.
🧠 Imagine you're waiting for a message on your phone:
📱➡️ Every few seconds, you unlock your phone and check your messages manually.
That’s polling — your STM32 is in a loop, repeatedly checking if a pin has changed or data has arrived.
📌 Pros:
Simple to implement 👍
Easy to understand 🧑‍🏫
📌 Cons:
Wastes CPU time 😫
Not efficient for real-time response ⏱️

🧑‍💻 Example:

while (1) {
 if (buttonPressed) {
 // Do something
 }
}


⚡ Interrupt Method:

Interrupts are like your smart assistant 📲 that only alerts you when something important happens — no need to keep checking manually.

Interrupts are like your phone buzzing when you get a message 📲
💡 You don’t check the phone all the time — instead, when a message comes, your phone notifies you 🔔
That’s an interrupt — your STM32 can do other tasks, and when an event occurs (e.g., a pin changes), it pauses its work, handles the event in a special function (ISR), then continues.
📌 Pros:
Efficient ⏱️
Ideal for real-time events ⚙️
📌 Cons:
Slightly more complex 😵
Must keep ISR short and fast ⚠️


🧑‍💻 Example:




void EXTI0_IRQHandler(void) {
 if (EXTI->PR & EXTI_PR_PR0) { // Check if interrupt came from line 0
 // Handle button press
 EXTI->PR |= EXTI_PR_PR0; // Clear interrupt flag
 }
}

Polling 🔁1:

High (checks constantly) 🔄
Slower (can miss fast events) 🐌
Simple logic 😎
May miss short signals 😬
Wasteful if event is rare ❌
Good for slow changes 🐢
You check the oven 👀
Hard to multitask 😵



Interrupt ⚡:

Low (responds only when needed) ✅
Instant response ⚡🚀
Needs proper setup/config 👨‍💻
Can catch quick pulses 📶
Efficient for rare/critical events 💎
Ideal for time-critical tasks ⏰
Oven timer rings 🔔
Great for multitasking 🧠💪



📌 When to Use What?
Button press (occasional) 🖲️ : Interrupt ⚡ : Don't waste CPU cycles!
Reading sensor data every 1s 🌡️ : Polling 🔁 : Simple loop is enough
Communication event (e.g., USART) 📡 : Interrupt ⚡ : Real-time response needed
LED blinking with delay 💡 : Polling 🔁 : No external event to wait for
